        <br />

        This webpage is an online or webpage version of ScoreJudo version
        5. &nbsp; It is not as comprehensive or powerful as the executable
        version since the entire page is written in HTML and Javascript
        which is really a client side scripting language rather than a
        full-blown high level language. Nevertheless it is a stop gap
        solution for local judo tournaments where a windows PC or laptop
        may not be available. &nbsp; Since this online version is nothing
        more than a webpage it should run on any device capable of running
        a browser. &nbsp; It has been tested on FireFox and Chrome and
        validates to W3C standards with zero errors or warnings, which
        means it should run on just about anything, including big screen
        smartphones and tablets. &nbsp; To make it truly portable, simply
        save the webpage as scorejudo.html (file menu, SAVE AS) and carry
        this single 65 kilobyte file around on a memory stick, smartphone,
        iPad, netbook or similar device and you have scorejudo in your
        pocket. &nbsp;
        <br />
        <br />
        <h2>How to operate.</h2>
        &nbsp; It is <b>strongly recommended</b> that you use a proper
        mouse with this app. &nbsp;
        <br />
        <br />
        Open the page (scorejudo.html) in your browser, maximise the
        window, and using the FONT size links in the bottom left corner
        (the three "A"s), adjust the image to JUST fill the screen and no
        more - that is to say, adjust so that the green clock band reaches
        to the bottom of the screen (or almost). &nbsp;
        <br />
        <br />
        Click on the default match times (bottom right corner) and set the
        default match duration - startup default is 5 minutes but you can
        choose 1, 2, 3 and 4 minute match times. &nbsp;
        <br />
        <br />
        If you wish to use the player database and your browser supports
        it, enter the names of all the players (one player per line) and
        click UPDATE PLAYER LIST. &nbsp;
        <br />
        <br />
        When the ref shouts <b>Hajime</b>, click the Hajime link or hit
        the SPACEBAR; the timer will start. &nbsp;
        <br />
        <br />
        When the ref shouts <b>Matte</b>, click the same link (or hit the
        SPACEBAR again) which will now bear the caption "Matte" and the
        clock will stop.
        <br />
        <br />
        If the blue player achieves a holddown and the ref declares
        "Osaekomi", click the Osaekomi link. &nbsp; The Osaekomi timer
        will begin. &nbsp; Toketa will stop the Osaekomi clock. &nbsp;
        Alternatively, just clicking the osaekomi clock numeral itself
        will do the same thing and is a bigger target for a wayward mouse.
        &nbsp; Sonomama will stop both the Osaekomi clock AND the main
        clock. &nbsp; As Osaekomi progresses, as early as possible, click
        either the white or the blue button to indicate TORI (for both
        your own information and the referee`s). &nbsp; To remove a time
        from the Osaekomi clock after the referee and everyone else with
        an interest has read it and the match has moved on, click "reset".
        &nbsp;
        <br />
        <br />
        Individual <b>scores</b> can be progressed by clicking on the
        numbers directly, and such can be back-tracked by clicking on the
        subtract (minus sign) link just above each Ippon, Wazari and Yuko
        score numeral. &nbsp;
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Penalties</b> - click a player`s "yellow card" to penalise that
        player. Clicking the little arrows above the yellow card adds or
        subtracts one Shido at a time. &nbsp; Issuing shido no longer
        upgrqades the other players score.
        <br />
        <br />

        For a <b>golden score situation</b>, click the "Reset for golden
        Score" link which will reset the clock but will not reset the
        player names or scores or penalties. &nbsp; Note that the clock
        now runs FORWARDS for ever with the advent of the new rule which
        removes the time limitation from Golden Score - the match runs
        until one player scores, however long that may take - hence the
        clock is reset to ZERO and counts upwards. &nbsp; &nbsp;
        <br />
        <br />

        At <b>full time</b>, the clock will pause at zero and an
        exclamation mark will flash, prompting the timekeeper to ring a
        shopkeepers bell or sound effect (if a hold-down is not in
        progress of course). &nbsp; In some countries the timekeeper does
        not ring a bell but tosses a small bean bag onto the mat near the
        referee`s feet, which makes for less noise confusion and chaos at
        a large crowded venue. &nbsp;
        <br />
        <br />
        If resetting the board results in an incorrect match time, click
        the appropriate "Minutes" link - that setting will now be the
        default and the scoreboard will completely RESET. &nbsp; You can
        manually manipulate the clock to precise times to correct for
        mistakes during a match. &nbsp; Scroll down to the HELP area.
        &nbsp; Resetting the board advances the bout count by one but you
        can manually move that number up or down with the little arrows
        next to it - same for the MAT Number. &nbsp;
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Players names</b> - upgraded - players names are now chosen
        simply from the dropdown selectors which are populated by the
        players database of names.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Colour Schemes</b> - The board has 3 small clickable buttons at
        the lower left corner of the screen. &nbsp; These allow selection
        of 3 colour schemes - the most common IJF style of white over
        blue, the traditional older style of red over white and a hybrid
        version of white over red. &nbsp; The IJF version is most common
        and lists the first called white suited player on top (enters mat
        on referee`s right) and the blue below. &nbsp; The traditional
        style is often seen in Japan and in those organisations which
        follow the traditional convention of calling the red belted player
        first and to the referee`s right and the white belted player
        second and to the referee`s left. &nbsp; The hybrid version is
        sometimes used by tournaments run in the IJF manner and convention
        but with an allowance for red belts or sashes instead of blue gis,
        as sometimes seen in Masters and Veteran, Mons and Special Needs
        events. &nbsp;
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Second Monitor</b> - if your laptop, PC, iPad, netbook or other
        device is able, connect a second large monitor or TV set
        configured to DUPLICATE the device screen and use that as the
        public display, facing the mat and referee. &nbsp; Unlike the
        executable version of ScoreJudo with its second slave window and
        other goodies, this screen should NOT be configured so as to
        extend your desktop onto it - it should be a straight duplication
        of your device screen.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>The Bell</b> - nrmally the bell will ring automatically at end
        of match time but you can ring it manually for any reason at any
        time. &nbsp; doing so will have no effect whatsoever on any facet
        of the scoreboard and will not force or stop or start the clock.
        &nbsp; There are several sounds selectable for the bell; it is
        advisable to select a different sound for each mat in a multi mat
        tournament (siren, chime, buzzer etc) to reduce confusion amongst
        players and referees. &nbsp;
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>WARNING</b> - Avoid hitting the RELOAD (refresh) button or the
        BACK or FORWARD buttons on your browser while a match is in
        progress - if you do, the page will reload and all your settings
        and font sizes will be lost, the clocks will stop and reset, the
        players names will zero out and you`ll have to start again. There
        is no reason to click these buttons, every scoreboard function and
        HELP is available through clickable links on the screen. &nbsp;
        <br />
        <br />
        Need more draw sheets? - click HELP or scroll down to the PRINT
        SCORE SHEET link. &nbsp; Set your browser to NOT print headers or
        footers and DO print background colours - print it! &nbsp; Make
        sure popups are not blocked in your browser preferences. &nbsp;
        <br />
        <br />
        <h2>What`s missing?</h2>
        The online version does not have sound - it is up to the table
        officials to ring a bell or similar when the time is up. &nbsp; I
        made the decision that if it could not be done in pure Javascript
        and in one single webpage file it was simply not going to get
        done. &nbsp; I know that web page sound is possible through a
        variety of means including Flash, but I had to decide on some
        cut-off point and simplicity won the day - time keeping and score
        tracking is the major role of this scoreboard. &nbsp;
        <br />
        <br />
        The clock does not stop on scoring of an ippon, meaning that for
        those matches that allow more than two wazari or more than one
        ippon (e.g. MONster or tiny tot rules), the scoreboard is by
        default ready for such. But for normal matches this simply means
        the timekeeper needs to manually click Matte to stop the clock in
        the event of an Ippon. &nbsp; This behaviour also makes it
        eminently suitable for Special Needs matches for which it is
        common practice to allow for several (nominal) wazari and Ippons
        where the aim might be more to give the players a "full match"
        experience rather than a "quick win". &nbsp;
        <br />
        <br />
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        ScoreJudo Online is in no way intended to be a proper replacement
        for the downloadable Windows XP-Vista-7 &nbsp; application which
        is being used in more than 20 countries and has been adopted as
        the offical scoreboard by several State and National bodies around
        the globe and has many more features than this very basic,
        extremely simple "emergency" solution. &nbsp;
        <br />
        <br />
        Nevertheless, with version 1.8 and its additional features, there
        is less need for the Windows executable version now and it may
        well be discontinued as the webpage HTML version becomes
        increasingly popular because of its ability to run on anything.
        &nbsp;
        <br />
        <br />
        The page was written entirely in Javascript and all scripts and
        styles are included in the actual page coding. &nbsp; This means
        that with this single file (scorejudo.html) saved on your device
        or on a memory stick you are good to go - no separate style
        sheets, script files, pictures, flash movies or other plugins of
        any kind are required. &nbsp; This also means that you are free to
        play with the coding yourself if you so wish and are prepared to
        leave the original copyright notice in the file. &nbsp; &nbsp;
        Since I am a self confessed Javascript mug-newbie I make no
        pretence at the excellence of the code. Javascript is not a
        language I use professionally. &nbsp; To be entirely accurate,
        &nbsp; for the interest of those who care, it was actually written
        in PHP which in turn generates the single HTML file from disparate
        style, script, text files. &nbsp; If however Javascript is your
        game feel free to email me with suggestions and cleaned up code
        and I shall include you in the contributers list. &nbsp;
        <br />
        <br />

        Staate and National parent bodies wishing to distribute a copy of
        this software with their logo on it are most welcome to contact me
        with such requests - simply forward a reasonably good quality JPG
        or PNG file of your logo and we shall endeavour to accommodate it
        on the scoreboard somewhere.

        <br />
        <br />
        Log of changes:-
        <br />
        <br />
        2010 - First public version: Ver 1.2
        <br />
        <br />
        March 2011 - Ver 1.3 - Addition of Ippon Wazari yuko labels above
        scores.
        <br />
        <br />
        Change to Osaekomi clocks - if the table operator makes a mistake
        and clicks the wrong Osaekomi clock, he or she can quickly
        transfer the score to the correct Osaekomi clock by simply
        clicking on the the correct clock while the wrong clock is STILL
        RUNNING. &nbsp; This will not work unless the wrong clock is
        actually running. &nbsp; Since it is not normal practice to click
        on one clock while the other is running, Scorejudo interprets this
        as a MISTAKE CORRECTION and behaves accordingly. &nbsp;
        <br />
        <br />
        Removal of the "undo" labels in favour of small back arrows.
        &nbsp; The undo labels were confusing to some, hence this change.
        &nbsp;
        <br />
        <br />
        Provision of a RED version (scorejudo_red.html) &nbsp; &nbsp; Many
        juniors, veterans and special needs matches are run under
        traditional rules where expectation of a blue gi is not practical.
        &nbsp; With red sashes, a traditional red scoreboard is preferred
        by some. &nbsp; There is nothing to prevent running both the blue
        and the red version in separate browser windows, facilitiating a
        quick change to either, each with their own preferences set and
        ready to go. &nbsp;
        <br />
        <br />

        March 2013 - version 1.7 - Scrapping of red version due to lack of
        demand. Incorporation of the IJF 2013 rule changes, including no
        automatic Yuko-Wazari etc for Shidos - golden score to run
        indefinitely, thus the clock counts forwards not "down" when
        golden score is in play. &nbsp; Osaekomi clocks stop at 20
        seconds, not 25 seconds.
        <br />
        <br />

        March 2013 - version 1.8 trial of persistent player name database
        using HTML5 ability to store data locally without dependence on
        cookies. &nbsp;
        <br />
        <br />
        2014 - Reconstituted ability to run a red version from within the
        blue version.
        <br />
        <br />

        March 2015 - version 2.2 &nbsp; Keyboard shortcuts enabled. &nbsp;
        Initial shortcut restricted to SPACE BAR for Hajime-Matte toggle.
        &nbsp;
        <br />
        <br />
        October 2015 - version 3.0 &nbsp; Major revamp of internals,
        Osaekomi clock for each player removed and replaced with one
        global clock. &nbsp; Added ability to set clocks to specific
        times. &nbsp; Ability to change to traditional format improved by
        putting red player on top. Ability to ring bell manually for any
        reason any time. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Ability to "brand" your
        edition by editing the branding.html file with any valid html
        markup. &nbsp;
        <br />
